🔒 HackMOL - Women's Safety Emergency Response System
🚨 Overview
HackMOL is a real-time women safety application built to provide immediate support in emergency situations. In the face of danger, the victim can press an SOS button from the app. This triggers a chain of responses:

Sends the victim's live location and a live video stream link.

Notifies nearby volunteers (other app users) with a pop-up alert.

If a volunteer agrees to help, the app generates a routing path guiding them directly to the victim.

Our goal is to reduce emergency response time and create a community-supported safety network.

💡 Key Features
🆘 SOS Button: Instantly sends location and video link.

📍 Live Location Sharing: Broadcasts the victim’s real-time GPS location.

📹 Live Video Stream: Sends a secure video stream link for better situational awareness.

🔔 Volunteer Notification System: Nearby users receive an alert and can opt-in to help.

🗺️ Real-Time Routing: Shows an optimized path from the volunteer to the victim.
